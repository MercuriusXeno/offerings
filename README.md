# Offerings 0.0.1

Sacrifice unwanted items, at altars throughout the world, to enhance wands and flasks.

1. Place what to enhance on the upper altar.
2. Place offerings on the lower altar.
3. Pick up the item on the upper altar.

WAND MERGING
============
Everything combines "thoughtlessly".
The result stats of the wand are based on the combined "worth" of all the wands together.
The higher stats get, the harder it is to increase them, so you don't get 100% of the sacrificed stats, especially as the wands get stronger.

FLASK MERGING
=============
When flasks merge they just kinda get bigger.
Flask transfer rates improve relative to their size so at really big sizes, they can empty and fill much faster than before too.
Note that enemies thrown flasks do count, but often give funky material barrel sizes like 401. Don't be surprised if your flask has a weird max.

SECRETS
=======
You can offer things besides wands and flasks. More to come on this. Not 100% finished.
