Workshop 3.0 - Other Stuff Edition

CHANGES
=======
3.0 IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH SAVES USING 2.5 OR EARLIER.
DO NOT USE BOTH MODS AT ONCE.

FEATURES
========

* Wand merging, simplified:
1. Put the wand you want to keep on the floating altar.
2. Put wands you're sacrificing on the big altar below it. 
3. Pick up the wand you want to keep, now enhanced.

FLASK MERGING
=============
Place a flask on the altar and then offer the rest of the recipe.

Any Flask <- Any Flask = Kept Flask with combined capacity and contents. Beware reactions.
Any Flask <- Kiauskivi = Kept Flask with "Tempered", becoming unbreakable.
Any Flask <- Vuoksikivi = Kept Flask with "Flooding", one click dumps its contents. Fill Rate massively increased (does this do anything?)
Any Flask <- Emerald Tablet = Kept Flask with "Inert", reduces reactivity by 20. (Set to 0 if default) (Reactive and Inert cancel out)
Any Flask <- Book = Kept Flask with "Reactive", increases reactivity by 20. Stacks up to 4. (Reactive and Inert cancel out)
Any Flask <- Ukkoskivi = Kept Flask with "Remote", the mouth of the flask is also the mouse cursor.
Any Flask <- HenkevÃ¤ Potu = Kept Flask with "Transmuting", convert other materials to the dominant flask material. Can't be changed.

(I may expand upon this list, if I get the urge. This felt like a good place to stop and test.)

WAND MERGING
============
1. Spread, cast delay and reload are set to the lowest among all wands.
2. Capacity is set to the highest among all wands.  
3. Shuffle and spells cast are left alone. The kept wand determines these.
4. Mana regen and capacity use an iterative formula:
  Sort list, take worst (w) and next worst (n) wand stat (including formula results)
  result = n + (w/n)^0.5 * w (REPEAT UNTIL LIST EMPTY)

CREDITS
=======
I didn't come up with the workshop concept originally. You can find the original versions still:
1.0 by Megacrafter127
2.0 by Gladious
2.5 is by me, but don't use it. It's a mess.
